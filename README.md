# NOTE:
Sketchiepad is obselete. It is now replaced by [Sketchio](https://github.com/TeoJT/Sketchio) which features a complete UI, an internal code editor, and a complete overhaul to the underlying system, based on Timeway's engine.

## What is Sketchiepad?
Sketchiepad is a rudimentary tool that allows you to code animations thanks to the amazing Processing 3 rendering engine. It essentially simplifies the process of rendering bitmaps to a canvas and recording them as frames, complete with background sound/music and tools to make it easier to make your scene pretty without having to reposition everything by entering numbers repeatedly until it's in the right place.
